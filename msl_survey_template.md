# MSL FIELD INTELLIGENCE SURVEY
## CDK4/6 Inhibitor Formulary & Prescribing Patterns

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

**Complement FOI requests with qualitative field intelligence:**
- FOI tells us "What's on formulary?"
- MSL surveys tell us "What do oncologists actually prescribe and why?"

**Target:** 20-30 breast cancer oncologists across 10 priority trusts  
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Method:** In-person MSL visits or phone interviews

### **Introduction:**

*"Thank you for taking time today. As part of our ongoing support for breast cancer treatment, we're gathering insights on CDK4/6 inhibitor use patterns. This will help us better support clinicians like yourself. This should take about 5-10 minutes."*

### **Thank you & Close:**

*"Thank you very much for your time and insights. This information is extremely valuable for understanding real-world treatment patterns. Would it be helpful if I shared some recent MONALEESA trial updates or case studies with you?"*

## 📊 DATA ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### **After collecting 20-30 responses:**

**1. Formulary Status Summary**
- Create matrix: Trust × Drug × Status (First-line/Alternative/Restricted)
- Compare: How many trusts position Kisqali as first-line vs alternative?

**2. Market Share Estimates**
- Average % of patients receiving each CDK4/6 inhibitor
- By trust: Identify high-Kisqali vs high-Ibrance trusts

**3. Barrier Analysis**
- Most common barriers to Kisqali use
- Rank: Formulary > Cost > Familiarity > Side effects?

**4. Opportunity Sizing**
- Trusts with high patient volume + low Kisqali use = priority targets
- Trusts with "No significant barriers" = expansion opportunities

**5. KOL Identification**
- High-volume prescribers (>50 patients/year) = KOL targets
- Advisory board interest = engagement opportunities

---

## 🎯 TARGET RESPONDENT PROFILE

**Ideal Survey Participants:**

**Profile:**
- Consultant medical oncologist
- Breast cancer specialist
- Prescribes CDK4/6 inhibitors regularly
- Works at one of 10 priority trusts

**How to Identify:**
- Trust oncology department directories
- Conference speaker lists (UK breast cancer meetings)
- PubMed authors with trust affiliations
- Existing MSL relationship database

**Recruitment:**
- MSL cold outreach: "Would you have 10 minutes to discuss CDK4/6 inhibitor use patterns?"
- Existing relationships: "Could I get your feedback on something?"
- Advisory board candidates: "We're gathering field insights..."

## 🔄 COMBINING MSL + FOI DATA

| Intelligence Source | FOI Request | MSL Survey |
|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Timeline** | 8 weeks | 4-6 weeks |
| **Data Type** | Quantitative | Qualitative |
| **Coverage** | 50 trusts | 20-30 oncologists (10 trusts) |
| **Tells You** | Official formulary status | Real prescribing behavior |
| **Strength** | Systematic, documented | Context, "why" behind decisions |
| **Weakness** | Doesn't capture prescriber behavior | Small sample size |

**Best Practice:** Use both

**Example Combined Insight:**
- FOI: "Kisqali is listed as 'alternative' at Trust X"
- MSL: "But 3 of 4 oncologists surveyed at Trust X use it first-line anyway"
- Action: Formulary upgrade submission has internal support

---

## 📈 EXPECTED INTELLIGENCE OUTPUT

**After 6-8 weeks:**

✅ **Formulary Map:** 50 trusts with CDK4/6 positioning  
✅ **Prescribing Patterns:** Real-world Kisqali vs Ibrance usage by trust  
✅ **Barrier Analysis:** Top 5 barriers to Kisqali adoption  
✅ **Opportunity Matrix:** Trust-level targets ranked by potential  
✅ **KOL Database:** 20-30 engaged breast cancer oncologists  

**Strategic Actions Enabled:**
1. Target formulary submissions at trusts where Kisqali is "alternative"
2. Focus MSL education on trusts with low familiarity
3. Address specific barriers (cost, side effects, data gaps)
4. Recruit advisory board from high-engagement respondents
5. Publish real-world data from supportive KOLs

## 🤖 OPENCLAW AUTOMATION

**For production implementation:**

```python
# Automated MSL survey analysis

def analyze_survey_responses(responses):
    # Aggregate formulary status by trust
    formulary_matrix = create_trust_drug_matrix(responses)
    
    # Calculate market share estimates
    market_share = estimate_market_share(responses)
    
    # Identify barriers by frequency
    barriers = rank_barriers(responses)
    
    # Score trust opportunity
    opportunities = score_trust_opportunities(
        patient_volume=responses['Q11'],
        current_usage=responses['Q4'],
        barriers=responses['Q8']
    )
    
    # Generate action plan
    action_plan = {
        'high_priority_trusts': opportunities[:10],
        'formulary_targets': [t for t in trusts if kisqali_is_alternative(t)],
        'education_needs': [t for t in trusts if low_familiarity(t)],
        'kol_candidates': [r for r in responses if high_volume(r) and advisory_interest(r)]
    }
    
    return action_plan
```

**Cron job:**
- Weekly: Reminder to MSL team for survey completion targets
- Monthly: Analysis of accumulated responses
- Quarterly: Trend analysis (is Kisqali share growing?)

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

**This Week:**
1. Share survey template with MSL team
2. Identify 30 target oncologists (3 per priority trust)
3. Set MSL targets: 20-30 completed surveys in 6 weeks
4. Create tracking spreadsheet for responses

**Week 2-6: Execution**
- MSLs conduct surveys during regular visits
- Weekly check-ins: How many responses collected?
- Adjust approach if low response rate

**Week 7-8: Analysis**
- Aggregate data
- Generate trust-level opportunity matrix
- Combine with FOI request data
- Present findings to brand team
